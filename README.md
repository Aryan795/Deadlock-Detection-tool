📘 Deadlock Detection Tool
Automated Runtime Detection of Deadlocks Using Wait-For Graphs (WFG) + DFS Cycle Detection
🚀 Overview
Deadlocks occur when two or more processes wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.
This project provides an Automated Deadlock Detection Tool that:
Instruments lock acquisition & release events
Builds a Wait-For Graph (WFG) in real time
Runs DFS-based cycle detection
Alerts the user when a deadlock is detected
Displays the cycle path, processes involved, and resources causing contention
